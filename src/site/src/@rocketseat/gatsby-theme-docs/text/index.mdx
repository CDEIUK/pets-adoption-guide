Welcome to the [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovationâ€™s (CDEI)][cdei-gov-dot-uk] Privacy Enhnacing Technologies (PETs) Adoption Guide. The CDEI is an advisory body to the UK government on the opportunities and ethical challenges of using data-driven technologies.

We have been researching the role of privacy enhancing technologies in enabling safe, private and trustworthy use of data. These emerging technologies have the potential to be disruptive in enabling valuable data sharing and analysis whilst protecting privacy and confidentiality. For this potential to be fully realised, we need an environment that encourages and facilitates effective adoption of these technologies. To contribute to this, we have been investigating uses of PETs across a range of sectors, which has informed the creation of this Adoption Guide to aid decision-makers in thinking about how PETs might be used in their data projects.

On this site you will find:

- Background on [what PETs are](/what-are-pets), and the [opportunities](/opportunities) they present
- The core [Adoption Guide](/adoption-guide) - a question-based flowchart to aid decision-makers in thinking through which PETs may be useful in their projects
- A [repository of real world use cases](/repository) collated from our research so far
- A catalogue of [additional resources](/additional-resources) for further reading
- An [explanation of our future work](/future-work) in this area

This site is a living product, and we welcome any questions, comments and feedback which we can use to improve it. Please do get in touch by emailing [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email].
