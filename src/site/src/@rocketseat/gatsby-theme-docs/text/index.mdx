Welcome to the [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovationâ€™s (CDEI)][cdei-gov-dot-uk] Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) Adoption Guide!

This is an interactive site we have built in order to help organisations consider how the adoption of PETs could unlock opportunities for data-driven innovation, whilst protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive data. This guide is primarily aimed at technical architects and product owners working on projects that involve the sharing or processing of sensitive information.

## Background

We have been researching the role of privacy enhancing technologies in enabling safe, private and trustworthy use of data. These emerging technologies have the potential to be disruptive in enabling valuable data sharing and analysis whilst protecting privacy and confidentiality. For this potential to be fully realised, we need an environment that encourages and facilitates effective adoption of these technologies. To contribute to this, we have been investigating uses of PETs across a range of sectors, which has informed the creation of this Adoption Guide to aid decision-makers in thinking about how PETs might be used in their data projects.

On this site you will find:

- Background on [what PETs are](/what-are-pets), and the [opportunities](/opportunities) they present
- The core [Adoption Guide](/adoption-guide) - a question-based flowchart to aid decision-makers in thinking through which PETs may be useful in their projects
- A [repository of real world use cases](/repository) collated from our research so far
- A catalogue of [additional resources](/additional-resources) for further reading
- A [contact](/contact-us) page - we are keen to receive constructive feedback on the site so that future iterations can be as effective as possible
