## Public sector initiatives

- The Royal Society's 2019 report Protecting Privacy in Practice provides case studies for a number of the emerging PETs discussed on this site, as well as Personal Data Store technology.
- The ICO has produced a <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-sharing-information-hub/">Data Sharing Code of Practice</OutboundLink>, and have released a <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-building-on-the-data-sharing-code-our-plans-for-updating-our-anonymisation-guidance/">roadmap</OutboundLink> for updating their guidance on anonymisation and pseudonymisation which will explore the role that privacy enhancing technologies can play in enabling safe and lawful access to data. Some guidance is already provided in a machine learning context in the ICO's <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/how-should-we-assess-security-and-data-minimisation-in-ai/#whatdataminimisation">guidance on AI and data protection</OutboundLink>.
- The UKRI-funded <OutboundLink href="https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/">National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online</OutboundLink> (REPHRAIN) was established in 2020 and brings together academics and researchers from the universities of Bristol, Edinburgh, Bath, Kingâ€™s College London, and University College London. The Centre is taking an interdisciplinary approach to researching online harms, including the role of PETs. Of particular interest is the creation of a <OutboundLink href="https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/rephrain-toolbox/">PETs Testbed</OutboundLink>, incorporating network and end-nodes on which PETs will be rolled out and evaluated, both from the systems and human experiences perspective.

## Online courses

Open-source community <OutboundLink href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</OutboundLink> provides a number of online courses:

- The <OutboundLink href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity">Our Privacy Opportunity</OutboundLink> course is a short course covering fundamental privacy concepts, and providing an overview of some of the privacy-enhancing technologies available. This is a one day course requiring no technical knowledge or coding skills.
- The <OutboundLink href="https://www.udacity.com/course/secure-and-private-ai--ud185">Secure and Private AI</OutboundLink> Udacity course, in association with Facebook AI, is a technical course introducing methods for privacy-preserving machine learning, including federated learning, differential privacy, and encrypted computation. Beginner-level knowledge of Python and machine learning are required.
- The <OutboundLink href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/foundations-of-private-computation">Foundations of Private Computation</OutboundLink> course is a technical course covering various cryptographic concepts and privacy-enhancing technologies. The course aims to teach every major privacy-preserving technique to an intermediate level. Beginner-level Python is required.
