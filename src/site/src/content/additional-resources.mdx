## Public sector initiatives

- The Royal Society's 2019 report Protecting Privacy in Practice provides case studies for a number of the emerging PETs discussed on this site, as well as Personal Data Store technology. The Royal Society will refresh their report in 2021 (TODO: confirm with Franck what we can say here).
- The ICO has produced a <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-sharing-information-hub/">Data Sharing Code of Practice</OutboundLink>, and have released a <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-building-on-the-data-sharing-code-our-plans-for-updating-our-anonymisation-guidance/">roadmap</OutboundLink> for updating their guidance on anonymisation and pseudonymisation which will explore the role that privacy enhancing technologies might play in enabling safe and lawful data sharing. Some guidance is already provided in a machine learning context in the ICO's <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/how-should-we-assess-security-and-data-minimisation-in-ai/#whatdataminimisation">guidance on AI and data protection</OutboundLink>.
- The UKRI-funded <OutboundLink href="https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/">National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online</OutboundLink> (REPHRAIN) was established in 2020 and brings together academics and researchers from the universities of Bristol, Edinburgh, Bath, Kingâ€™s College London, and University College London. The Centre is taking an interdisciplinary approach to researching online harms, including the role of PETs. Of particular interest is the creation of a <OutboundLink href="https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/rephrain-toolbox/">PETs Testbed</OutboundLink>, incorporating network and end-nodes on which PETs will be rolled out and evaluated, both from the systems and human experiences viewpoint.

## Online courses

Open-source community <OutboundLink href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</OutboundLink> provides a number of online courses:

- TODO: add Udacity one
- The <OutboundLink href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity">Our Privacy Opportunity</OutboundLink> course provides a short overview of privacy-preserving AI requiring no technical knowledge or coding skills
- The <OutboundLink href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/foundations-of-private-computation">Foundations of Private Computation</OutboundLink> course provides hands-on learning for developers, only requiring beginner knowledge of Python.
