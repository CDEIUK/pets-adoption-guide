Based on your responses to the questions in the adoption guide, you may want to consider homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive data in your project.

## Why homomorphic encryption?

Relate back to the considerations of the guide...

You want to outsource the processing of sensitive data in its raw form to a third party provider.

Using homomorphic encryption means you can do this without the third party being able to read either the input data or the output of the results, as they remain encrypted throughout.
