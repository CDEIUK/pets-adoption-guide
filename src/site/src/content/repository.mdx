  Presented below is a repository of real-world use cases that leverage emerging
  PETs. This aims to showcase the variety of use cases and sectors that PETs are
  providing solutions for. By collating these examples, we hope that
  organisations will be better placed to learn from others about how PETs can be
  effectively applied in practice.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 900px;">
  Details of the use cases given in this repository are based on public
  information or information provided to us, and we have not had access to the
  systems themselves.

  Inclusion in this repository should not be interpreted as an endorsement or
  criticism.

If you have additional examples that you think should be included in the
repository, please do [contact us](/contact-us).
