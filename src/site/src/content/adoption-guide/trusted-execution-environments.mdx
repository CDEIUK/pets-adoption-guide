Based on your responses, you may want to consider trusted execution environments.

## What are trusted execution environments?

A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a processing environment isolated from a computer’s main processor and memory. Code or data held within this environment cannot be accessed from the main processor, and communications between the main processor and the TEE are encrypted.

The use cases for TEEs are similar to homomorphic encryption. A data controller can store their data within a TEE, to be operated on by an untrusted third party’s code also held within the TEE. Processing within the TEE occurs directly on unencrypted data - this means processing is likely to be faster than with homomorphic encryption, due to computational overhead incurred by the latter. Once calculated, the result is encrypted before being communicated back to the data controller, who has access to the appropriate decryption key.

## Why trusted execution environments?

There are two paths through the Adoption Guide leading to this page. Firstly:

- You want to enable raw data to be accessed by another party
- Sensitive information needs to be included in the dataset
- You are sharing the data so as to outsource data processing to the third party
- You are performing calculations that are highly complex and/or have low latency requirements

In this scenario, a TEE is potentially a suitable solution as it allows processing to be outsourced to a third party whilst the data remains protected in a secure processing environment, meaning the third party cannot access the sensitive information in the dataset. [Homomorphic encryption](/adoption-guide/homomorphic-encryption) could also be a suitable solution, depending on the specific calculations you want to perform; in general, TEEs may be better suited to more complex calculations or to scenarios requiring low latency.

Secondly:

- You want to collaborate with multiple partners to conduct analysis on your collective data
- Data processing needs to be done centrally
- Sensitive information needs to be included in the dataset

In this case, each party could upload their data into a shared TEE for data processing, so that no one party sees the data contributed by any other party.

## Limitations to consider

- TEEs may be at risk of side-channel attacks, where information about the computation taking place within a TEE are inferred from signals produced by the computing system, such as power consumption or memory utilisation.
- As TEEs are hardware-based, they can be difficult to patch for vulnerabilities. For example, if a new side-channel attack vector is discovered, the physical chip containing the TEE may need to be replaced to mitigate the threat.
- There is no industry standard for interacting with TEEs, and each vendor's TEE design is bespoke. Applications leveraging TEEs thus have to be coded according to the TEE vendor's API, which can lead to vendor lock-in.
