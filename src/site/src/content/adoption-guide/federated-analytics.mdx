Based on your responses, you may want to consider a federated analytics approach.

## What is federated analytics?

Federated analytics is a paradigm for executing a computer program against decentralised data. This involves a party transferring the program to the server or device on which the data is situated, executing it on the server or device with the data in situ, and communicating the results back to the originating party. In this way, no data is directly revealed to the party.

## Why federated analytics?

Your answers to the questions in the Adoption Guide indicate that:

- You want to use data that is held by others, potentially in combination with data you hold
- Data processing can be performed on the servers of the parties whose data you want to use
- You want to perform traditional analysis on the data, rather than train a machine learning model

Using federated analytics is therefore a possible solution, as it enables you to carry out data analysis on remote datasets held by others whilst that data remains confidential

## Limitations to consider

- Although federated analytics provides no direct access to the data, it is possible that information about individuals in the dataset could be inferred from the output of the analysis. Performing the analysis in a differentially private way is one method for mitigating this risk.
- Not having direct access to the data can make it more difficult to develop, test, and troubleshoot code. Details of the schema and standards used by the remote database should be shared to help mitigate this, as well as dummy data that a developer can use to validate the functionality of their code.
