Based on your responses, you may want to consider using multi-party computation.

## What is multi-party computation?

A multi-party computation (MPC) protocol enables a function taking input from multiple parties to be jointly computed, whilst each participating party keeps their input secret from the others. This typically involves fragmenting data over multiple networked nodes, such that each node hosts an “unintelligible shard” of data; inspection of a single shard does not reveal information about the original data. Each node computes a function on its shard, and the outcomes are aggregated into a final result.

To gain an intuitive understanding of MPC, consider a group of employees who want to determine their average salary, without revealing their individual salaries to one another. The below figure illustrates how MPC can be implemented using additive secret sharing, relying on basic mathematical properties of addition to split the computation between the parties such that salaries remain confidential. A correct result is obtained by recombining the results of each party’s computations. In practice, MPC protocols are more complex than this naive example, so as to be secure and support a wide range of operations.

## Why multi-party computation?

Your answers to the questions in the Adoption Guide indicate that:

- You want to collaborate with multiple partners to conduct analysis on your collective data
- Data processing can be performed on the servers of the parties whose data you want to use
- You want to perform traditional analysis on the data, rather than train a machine learning model
- All parties involved can learn the outcome of the computation

Using a multi-party computation protocol is therefore a possible solution, as this enables computations to be performed across data held by multiple organisations. The participating organisations only learn the output of the computation, with each organisation's raw data remaining confidential.

## Limitations to consider

- MPC protocols typically do not scale to generic data analysis tasks, meaning protocols have to be tailored to the specific task at hand.
- The need for nodes to talk to one another incurs a communications overhead in comparison to computing on a single, centralised dataset. This means that more complex protocols, that require a greater number of exchanges of information between nodes, may be impractical in real-world setups.
- Dishonest and/or colluding parties could potentially disrupt an MPC protocol or leak information from the system - protocols should be designed for resiliency to any such attack vectors.
- There may be situations where the output from an MPC protocol can be used to infer information about the input data. As an illustrative example, imagine a system that calculates the percentage of individuals testing positive for a disease. You also know which individuals are participating in the study. If the result is 60%, you cannot determine which specific individuals are positive. However, if the result is 100%, you know with certainty that every individual is positive - personal information has been leaked. It is therefore important to understand the knowledge each participant in the network has, and what the range of potential results is, so that steps can be taken to minimise the risk of unintended information leakage.
