Based on your responses, it may not currently be workable to use PETs in your project. You may instead need to share data directly between parties, and you should establish a data sharing agreement in order for this to be done in a responsible way.

## What is a data sharing agreement?

As per <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-sharing-a-code-of-practice/data-sharing-agreements/">the ICO's guidance</OutboundLink>, a data sharing agreement is a document setting out the purpose of data sharing between parties, covering what happens to the data at each stage, and setting standards for how data is used. A data sharing agreement can help the parties involved better understand each of their roles and responsibilities.

Whilst it is not a legal requirement to create a data sharing agreement, it can help organisations demonstrate that they are meeting their accountability obligations under UK GDPR.

In addition to establishing a data sharing agreement, you should also ensure best practices around information governance and cybersecurity are followed. For example, access control systems and logging infrastructure should be in place so that data access can be restricted and monitored. Furthermore, although novel PETs may not be appropriate for your use case, it may be useful to implement more traditional [de-identification techniques](/adoption-guide/de-identification).

## Why a data sharing agreement?

There are several routes through the adoption guide that could have brought you to this page. Firstly:

- You hold data that you want to share with a third party
- You want to share the raw, row-level data
- Sensitive information needs to be included in the data
- You are sharing data so that the third party can autonomously conduct their own data analysis on this row-level data

As you want to provide the third party with the row-level data, including sensitive information, a data sharing agreement is necessary. However, you may want to consider whether it would be acceptable to provide just a subset of all rows in the dataset, and whether you could make this data available via an authenticated API, rather than sending the dataset directly to the third party.

Secondly:

- You hold data that you want to share with a third party
- You don't want to share the raw data, but rather insights derived from the raw data
- Either the structure of the data means these insights cannot be related to a population, or the data can be related to a population but with too small a population size for differntial privacy to be workable

In this case, you want to share insights derived from the raw data, but those insights could leak sensitive information from the underlying dataset. Differential privacy can help mitigate such information leakage, but that cannot be used here. Therefore, it may be sensible to establish a data sharing agreement before sharing these insights.

Thirdly:

- You want to use data that is held by others, potentially in combination with data you hold
- Data processing cannot be performed on the servers of the parties whose data you want to use
- Sensitive information needs to be included in the dataset

In this case, sensitive data from other parties is collected centrally. In this arrangement, it is especially important that each organisation understand their roles and responsibilities toward the governance of this data. These should be established in a data sharing agreement.

Depending on the specific use case, it may be the case that you and other parties are acting as joint controllers over the data being shared, which comes with additional legal obligations under UK GDPR. You should consult the <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/controllers-and-processors/what-does-it-mean-if-you-are-joint-controllers/">ICO's guidance</OutboundLink> for advice on this.
